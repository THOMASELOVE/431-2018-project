# Task C (Survey Editing) Instructions {#taskC}

## Deadline and Submission information

Task C is due at noon on 2018-10-23. Submit your Task C work via [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/). Please note that:

- Task D is also due at the same time. 
- We do not have class on 2018-10-23 because of CWRU's Fall Break.

Dr. Love will make the Draft Survey available as soon as possible after our initial work developing the Survey is complete.

## Task C has two parts.

In Task C, you need to submit a single Word document (maximum one page, 12 point font, with your name and Project Task C on the top of the Word document) containing the following two things: 

### A list of corrections and clarifications to the existing items in the Draft Survey.

This should include any typographical errors, clarifications or other edits that you wish to suggest for the items included in the Draft Survey. 

- If you found no errors or items in need of clarification, write a sentence saying that. 
- If you did find an issue, please be sure to specify the item number where you feel a revision is needed. 

**An Important Note**: In addition, If you see any items in the Draft Survey that you, personally, are not comfortable answering, for whatever reason, **please indicate that to us** in your response here, and we will consider revisions appropriately.

### A list of 0-3 new items that you want us to consider adding to the Draft Survey.

- Note that your new items *can* be but do not *need* to be anything you've previously suggested.
- Please begin with the following sentence: `I would like to submit # new items for consideration.` 
    - If your number of new items to suggest is zero, then you need not write anything else here.     - Should you wish to have us include 1-3 additional items, remember that nothing about sex, drugs, or performance in 431 can be asked.
    
For each new item you propose...

1. list the complete wording of the new item, being sure to specify the type (for instance, short answer, multiple choice, or checkbox) and the set of possible responses, as you did in Task A.
2. describe (in 2-3 complete sentences per new item) your reasons to include the item. 
    - Good reasons would begin with a statement of what you intend to do. As an example of such a statement, consider `I wish to study the result of this new item as a quantitative outcome across groups established by current item #*** from the survey.` Or, perhaps, something like: `I wish to use this new item as a grouping variable to study current item #***.` 
    - In either case, follow your statement with a short explanation as to why your new item's result is of interest, and is not already captured by the existing survey.

We will not consider more than 3 new items from anyone, and are eager to hold the total set of new items to 20 or less, across all 51 students. I hope that data related to each of the accepted project proposals will be found in the Draft Survey, as that is certainly the intention. So if that's the case, we are unlikely to need more than a few new items.
