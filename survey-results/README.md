# Project Survey Results

In Project Study 1, you will be responsible for completing six analyses of data from the Course Survey. The data are now available for you to begin your work, as are Dr. Love's comments on your survey comparison plans (Task D of the Project).

## The Data

## The Codebook for the Data

The [codebook for the survey data](http://bit.ly/431-2018-survey-data-codebook) has been substantially augmented by Dr. Love, to include information about missing values, frequencies and ranges for each variable. Please be sure to review the comments posted by Dr. Love there for every item you use in building your analyses.

## Survey Comparison Plans

Dr. Love's comments on your Survey Comparison Plan are in the Google Sheet at [http://bit.ly/431-2018-project-survey-plan-feedback](http://bit.ly/431-2018-project-survey-plan-feedback). As usual, log into Google via CWRU in order to open the sheet.
