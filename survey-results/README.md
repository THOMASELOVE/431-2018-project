# Project Survey: The Next Steps

In Project Study 1, you will analyze data provided by 49 respondents to the Course Project Survey.

## Key Points

1. Dr. Love has now reviewed and [commented on your Survey Comparison Plan](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/blob/master/survey-results/plan-comments.md). 
    - Five of the 49 students who submitted a Survey Comparison Plan for Analyses 1-6 had all six of their analyses approved by Dr. Love on their first try. Congratulations to those five people. 
    - For everyone else, you will need to make some changes to address Dr. Love's concerns. 
    - The [plan-comments page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/blob/master/survey-results/plan-comments.md) contains:
        - Details on how to find out what Dr. Love is worried about in your case, and 
        - Directions as to how to revise your plan so that you can complete your work on the Project.
    
2. Dr. Love has also prepared the data files you will need to do Project Study 1. See the details and [get the data here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/blob/master/survey-results/get-the-data.md).
    - Our [get-the-data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/blob/master/survey-results/get-the-data.md) has links to the five data sets you'll be merging and combining to get the data set you need. It also links to instructions for doing that merging and combining, and the results Dr. Love obtained when he did that merging and combining work, so you can check your own.
    - Combined with the material in the [Project Instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/) and the [Project Study 1 Demonstration](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study1), these two new pieces should get you started nicely, and enable you to complete Project Study 1.

## One Last Thing

Rafael Irizarry wrote a provocative blog post on 2018-11-01 called ["The role of academia in data science education"](https://simplystatistics.org/2018/11/01/the-role-of-academia-in-data-science-education/) which I found interesting.
