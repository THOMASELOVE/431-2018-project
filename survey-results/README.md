# Project Survey: The Next Steps

In Project Study 1, you will analyze data provided by 49 respondents to the Course Project Survey.

## Key Points

1. The data files you will need are now available, and this page details how you will get them, and provides additional insight into what you should do with the data once you have it, adding to the material in the [Project Instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/) and the [Project Study 1 Demonstration](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study1). Be sure you've read ALL of this page carefully, along with those other instructions.

2. Only 5 of the 49 students who submitted a Survey Comparison Plan for Analyses 1-6 had all six of their analyses approved by Dr. Love on their first try. Congratulations to those five people. For everyone else, you will need to make some changes to address Dr. Love's concerns. Details on how to find out what Dr. Love is worried about in your case, and directions as to how to revise your plan, and communicate those revisions back to us, [are available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/blob/master/survey-results/plan-comments.md).
