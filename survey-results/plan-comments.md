# Comments on your Survey Comparison Plans

Dr. Love's [comments on your Survey Comparison Plan](http://bit.ly/431-2018-project-survey-plan-feedback) are in this [Google Sheet](http://bit.ly/431-2018-project-survey-plan-feedback). As usual, log into Google via CWRU in order to open the sheet. Find your Homework ID number, and read the row of comments that apply to that HWID. 

## Study 1 Update is now due 2018-11-28 at noon (as part of Project Task F)

Whether you need to revise your plan or not, you will submit a **STUDY 1 UPDATE** document no later than noon on 2018-11-28 (the Wednesday after Thanksgiving) via Canvas, as part of what you submit for **Project Task F**.

You will build a single document in HTML, Word or PDF (which should have the filename `study1-update.html` or `study1-update.doc` or `study1-update.pdf`) to provide your update. In that document, please include the following:

1. The title "Study 1 Update for *Your Name*"
2. A list of the analyses (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and/or 6) that you are revising here. 
    - This **must** include things that you revised because I told you to do so, but it can also include any other changes you decided to make. 
    - If you are one of the five people who did not require any revisions in Dr. Love's comments, you can stop here if you are making no changes.
3. For each analysis listed above as being revised, specify what your **new** planned analysis will be, including the appropriate item numbers from the [codebook](http://bit.ly/431-2018-survey-data-codebook).

That's it. The whole thing shouldn't be more than a page.

## What is in Dr Love's comments in the [Feedback Google Sheet](http://bit.ly/431-2018-project-survey-plan-feedback)

You will find the following information:

1. A summary list of which of your analyses (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6) you will need to revise. Please check to be sure I've got this right, against my comments on each individual item. In many cases, even if a revision isn't necessary, you will want to read what I have to say to facilitate your implementing your plan.
    - A specification of which analyses (out of Analyses 1, 2 and 3) you will need to revise. (This just repeats the information from the previous bullet, but restricted to Analyses 1-3.)
    - A specification of which variables for Analyses 4, 5 and 6 (so variables J, K, L, M, and N) you will need to revise. (This just repeats information from the first bullet, but focued on Analyses 4-6.)
2. Dr. Love's comments on your planned Analysis 1, followed by the specifications of what you told us (in the Task D form) you were planning to do for Analysis 1, including variables **A** and **B** if you're using paired samples, and **C** and **Z** if you're using independent samples. The item numbers throughout this document match those in the [codebook](http://bit.ly/431-2018-survey-data-codebook). 
3. Dr. Love's comments on your planned Analysis 2, followed by the specifications of what you told us (in the Task D form) you were planning to do for Analysis 2, and your planned variables **D** and **Y**.
4. Dr. Love's comments on your planned Analysis 3, followed by the specifications of what you told us (in the Task D form) you were planning to do for Analysis 3, and your planned covariate **G**.
5. Dr. Love's comments on your planned factor variable **L**, followed by the specifications of what you told us you were planning to use there. Again, the item numbers throughout this document match the [codebook](http://bit.ly/431-2018-survey-data-codebook). 
6. Similar comments and plans for factor variables **M**, **J**, **K** and then **N**.
7. Comments on your backup variables, and then the specifications of what you planned to use for **Q**, **R**, **S** and **T**. You are not required to use your backup plans in revising your Analyses, but if you do intend to use them, review Dr. Love's comments first.

## Getting the Revisions Right

How can you be sure that your revised plan is OK? Ask a TA, through office hours, ideally, or via 431-help. Here are the key things we're thinking about...

- In Analysis 1, show that you are appropriately using paired samples, or independent samples. Show that you do actually have appropriate types of variables (quantitative in the paired case, one quantitative and one 2-category variable in the independent case).
    - If you are doing independent samples (analysis 1b), tell us the number of people who will be in each group, and tell us the means in each group.
    - If you are doing paired samples (analysis 1a), verify that the two variables you are comparing have the same units (hours, inches, rating points, whatever) and demonstrate that the paired difference is meaningful by explaining what the result is for one of the subjects.
- In Analysis 2, show that you do actually have a quantitative outcome, and that your factor variable has at least 3 categories. Demonstrate that each group (category) contains data on the quantitative outcome for at least 10 subjects.
- In Analysis 3, show that you do have a quantitative outcome, and a quantitative covariate, and explain which analysis (1b or 2) you are augmenting with a covariate.
- In Analysis 4, show the 2x2 table that comes from your choices of L and M (without any imputation) and demonstrate that there are at least 10 subjects in each row and 10 subjects in each column of your table. 
- In Analysis 5, show the larger cross-tabulation that comes from your choices of J and K (without any imputation) and demonstrate that there are at least 10 subjects in each row and 10 subjects in each column of your table.
- In Analysis 6, show that your variable N is categorical and has at least 3 levels, each with at least 10 subjects in it. 

## What You Specified in Task D (The Survey Comparison Plan)

[Backups](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/taskD.html#backups) | *Q* and *R* (quantitative), *S* (2 categories), *T* (3-6 categories)

## Reminders

- The [Study 1 demonstration project](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study1) is available now.
- You are to do either Analysis 1a or 1b, but not both.
