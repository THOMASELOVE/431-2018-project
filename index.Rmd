# Overview {-}

This website contains the Fall 2018 project information for PQHS / CRSP / MPHP 431: Statistical Methods in Biological & Medical Sciences, Section 1. 

## Your Project includes Two Studies {-}

Your final project for this course will result in a portfolio of work related to two studies.

**Study 1 - Class Survey**. In the first study, you (sometimes working individually, sometimes in a group) will design, administer, analyze and present the results of a survey designed to compare two or three groups of subjects on some *categorical* and *quantitative* outcomes we will develop from your initial ideas.

**Study 2 - Your Data**. In the second study, you (working individually) will propose a research question and relevant data of interest to you, and then complete all elements of a data science project designed to create a statistical model for a *quantitative* outcome, then use it for prediction and assess the quality of those predictions.

All materials related to the project (including these instructions) are maintained and linked at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project. The course home page is at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018
