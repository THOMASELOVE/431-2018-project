# Course Project Demonstration for Study 2

This page provides a demonstration of the sorts of analyses we are asking you to complete for your project Study 2 (using the class survey.)  

This demonstration study uses **simulated** data from a study of high blood pressure in 999 African-American adult subjects who are not of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. To be included, the subject had to be between 33 and 83 years of age at baseline, have a series of items available in their health record at baseline, including a baseline systolic blood pressure, and then return for a blood pressure check 18 months later. Our goal will be to build a prediction model for the subjectâ€™s change in systolic blood pressure over the 18-month period, on the basis of some of their characteristics at baseline. The data (which, again, are simulated), are in the `hbp_study.csv` data file available on [the Data and Code page of our website](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-data).

## Accessing the Materials

HTML and R Markdown versions, along with the data used to build the examples, are now available at the Shared Google Drive folder you can access (after logging into Google via CWRU) at http://bit.ly/431-2018-demo-study2.

## Current Status

The complete R Markdown and HTML documents were posted on 2018-11-12, on the Shared Google Drive, at http://bit.ly/431-2018-demo-study2.

## Is there a demonstration page for Study 1 (the Course Survey), too?

Yes, [it is here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study1)
