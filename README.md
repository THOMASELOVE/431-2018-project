# 431-2018-project

Materials for the Fall 2018 431 Course Project will arrive as soon as possible.

The current draft of the instructions is available at https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/

## Your Project includes TWO studies.

Your final project is a portfolio of work related to two studies you will complete.

### Study 1 - the Class Survey

In the first study, you (sometimes working individually, sometimes in a group) will design, administer, analyze and present the results of a survey designed to compare two or three groups of subjects on some *categorical* and *quantitative* outcomes we will develop from your initial ideas.

### Study 2 - Your Data

In the second study, you (working individually) will propose a research question and relevant data of interest to you, and then complete all elements of a data science project designed to create a statistical model for a *quantitative* outcome, then use it for prediction and assess the quality of those predictions.

## Your Project Work Will Include Multiple Tasks

and complete Instructions on how to do those tasks [are under development](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/).

## Old Class Surveys

We have posted PDF files of the 2014 Survey, the 2015 Survey, the 2016 Survey and the 2017 Survey to help you see what is involved. Remember that the questions in these Surveys were developed under somewhat different rules than are in place for the 2018 Projects.
