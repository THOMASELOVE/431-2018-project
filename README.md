# 431-2018-project

Materials for the Fall 2018 431 Course Project will arrive as soon as possible.

## Your Project includes TWO studies.

Your final project is a portfolio of work related to two studies you will complete.

### Study 1 - the Class Survey

In the first study, you (sometimes working individually, sometimes in a group) will design, administer, analyze and present the results of a survey designed to compare two or three groups of subjects on some *categorical* and *quantitative* outcomes we will develop from your initial ideas.

### Study 2 - Your Data

In the second study, you (working individually) will propose a research question and relevant data of interest to you, and then complete all elements of a data science project designed to create a statistical model for a *quantitative* outcome, then use it for prediction and assess the quality of those predictions.

## Your Project Work Will Include Multiple Tasks

and complete Instructions on how to do those tasks are on their way.
