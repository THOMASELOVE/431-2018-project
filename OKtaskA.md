Reactions to **Group Work** on Project Task A are in the Google Doc at http://bit.ly/431-2018-projecttaskA-groupwork

## Approved Project Proposals (Study 2)

- Wyatt Bensken, "Predicting Premature Death Rates from Key County Indicators"
    - [2018 County Health Rankings](http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/rankings-data-documentation) and [2010 Rural-Urban Commuting Area report](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-commuting-area-codes/) from USDA Economic Research Service
- Adam Brown, "CRASHing: Predicting Amount of Blood Products Required After Significant Hemorrhage"
    - CRASH-2 (Clinical Randomization of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Hemorrhage) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of whether tranexamic acid (TXA) use would improve mortality in trauma patients with significant hemorrhage [reported in The Lancet in 2010](https://www.thelancet.com/crash-2-2010). De-identified data on 20,207 patients are available through [the Freebird site (registration required)](https://ctu-app.lshtm.ac.uk/freebird/index.php/data-sharing/downloads/crash2/).
- Jane Carsey, "Sleep Duration and Sugar Intake, Diet, and Nutrition in U.S. Adults in NHANES"
    - [NHANES 2015-16 data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2015) from the CDC including several of the questionnaires available there.
- Julijana Conic, "Predictors of APACHE II Scores in Patients with Sepsis"
    - Uses data from Koyama K et al. "[Time course of immature platelet count and its relation to thrombocytopenia and mortality in patients with sepsis](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192064)" *PLOS One*, 2018-01-30. Data identified via [Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch), available through [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/Time_course_of_immature_platelet_count_and_its_relation_to_thrombocytopenia_and_mortality_in_patients_with_sepsis/5837823).
- Joseph Hnath, "State-level abortion restrictions and abortion utilization in U.S. counties"
    - Uses data from individual states, as compiled by Joseph as part of an economic analysis. Data include state-reported abortion counts and birth counts at the county level from 2006-2015, along with state-level abortion restriction policy changes [published by the Guttmacher Institute](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy) at the beginning of each year.
- Devlin Moyer, "Predicting survival from splicing changes in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes"
    - Uses data from 1300 patients analyzed at the Cleveland Clinic to study the role of disrupted regulation of pre-mRNA splicing in  several diseases, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The data planned for this project is part of a collaboration with Munich Leukemia Laboratory to analyze RNA-seq data from 1300 patients with either AML, myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).
- Michael Osterman, "A New Type of Cancer Prevention: Exercise?"
    - [The 500 Cities Project: Local Data for Better Health](https://www.cdc.gov/500cities/), from which [2017 release data can be obtained here](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities/500-Cities-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-2017-relea/6vp6-wxuq), is the primary source. The primary outcome of interest is the percentage of adults with non-skin cancer within a city. The key predictor is rates of having no leisure-time physical activity.
- Joshua Wu, "The Association Between Depression and Alcohol Consumption"
    - Uses data from the [National Survey on Drug Use and Health](https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/study-dataset/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-2016-nsduh-2016-ds0001-nid17185), obtained from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive.
