## Approved Project Proposals (Study 2)

- Wyatt Bensken, "Predicting Premature Death Rates from Key County Indicators"
    - [2018 County Health Rankings](http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/rankings-data-documentation) and [2010 Rural-Urban Commuting Area report](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-commuting-area-codes/) from USDA Economic Research Service
- Julijana Conic, "Predictors of APACHE II Scores in Patients with Sepsis"
    - Uses data from Koyama K et al. "[Time course of immature platelet count and its relation to thrombocytopenia and mortality in patients with sepsis](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192064)" *PLOS One*, 2018-01-30. Data identified via [Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch), available through [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/Time_course_of_immature_platelet_count_and_its_relation_to_thrombocytopenia_and_mortality_in_patients_with_sepsis/5837823).
- Devlin Moyer, "Predicting survival from splicing changes in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes"
    - Uses data from 1300 patients analyzed at the Cleveland Clinic to study the role of disrupted regulation of pre-mRNA splicing in  several diseases, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The data planned for this project is part of a collaboration with Munich Leukemia Laboratory to analyze RNA-seq data from 1300 patients with either AML, myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).
- Joshua Wu, "The Association Between Depression and Alcohol Consumption"
    - Uses data from the [National Survey on Drug Use and Health](https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/study-dataset/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-2016-nsduh-2016-ds0001-nid17185), obtained from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive.
