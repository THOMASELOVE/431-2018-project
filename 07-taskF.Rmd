## Deadline and Submission information

Task F is due at noon on 2018-11-14. Submit your Task F work through [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/). 

## Sharing Your Data Appropriately

Task F requires you to share your data for Study 2. The model for this Task is Jeff Leek's [Guide to Data Sharing](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing). Specifically, you will submit the following to Dr. Love by the deadline. 

1. a direct link to the raw data set (without any need for me to sign up for anything) or a .csv copy of the raw data set called `yourname-raw.csv`
2. a single .csv file with a name of your choice containing a clean, tidy data set for Study 2, along with 
3. a Word or PDF file containing both 
    a. a **codebook** section which describes every variable (column) and its values in your .csv file, 
    b. a **study design** section which reminds (and updates) us about the source of the data and your research question.

More to come.
