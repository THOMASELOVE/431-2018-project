# Purpose

It is hard to learn statistics (or anything else) passively; concurrent theory and application
are essential\footnote{Though by no means an original idea, this particular phrasing is stolen from Harry Roberts.} The distinguished statistician, George Box, noted that "statistics has no reason for existence except as the catalyst for investigation and discovery." I am primarily interested in your learning something interesting, useful and even valuable from your project.

An effective project will demonstrate:

1. The ability to create and formulate research questions that are statistically and scientifically appropriate.
2. The ability to turn research questions into measures of interest.
3. The ability to pull and merge and clean and tidy data, then present the data set following [Jeff Leek's guide to sharing data with a statistician](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing).
4. The ability to identify appropriate estimation / testing procedures for the class survey using both continuous and categorical outcomes.
5. The ability to build a reasonable model, including interactions and transformations to deal with non-linearity, assess the quality of the model and residual plots, then use the model to make predictions.
6. The ability to build a Table 1 to showcase potential differences between variables.
7. The ability to identify and (with help) solve problems that crop up
8. The ability to comment on your work within code, and in written and oral presentation.
9. The ability to build a Markdown-based report and a Markdown-based set of slides for presentation.
