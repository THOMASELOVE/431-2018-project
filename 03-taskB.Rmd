# Task B Instructions

For Task B, you need to submit via Blackboard, a single Word document (maximum one page, 12 point font, with your name and Project Task B on the top of the Word document) containing these two things: 

1. Your list of typographical errors, clarifications or other edits to the 96 items currently included in the Survey Draft, available at https://sites.google.com/a/case.edu/love-431/home/projects/class-survey. If you found no errors or items in need of clarification, write a sentence saying that. If you did find an issue, please be sure to specify the item number (1-96) where you feel a revision is needed. 
    + If you see any items in these 96 that you, personally, are not comfortable answering, **please indicate that to us** in this list, and we will consider revisions appropriately.
2. Your list of 0-3 new items\footnote{We will not consider more than 3 new items from anyone, and are eager to hold the total set of new items to 25 or less, across all 66 students. I would argue that data related to each of the 66 accepted project proposals may be found in the existing set of 96 items.} that you would like to add to the survey. 
    + Note that your new items *can* be but do not *need* to be anything you've previously suggested.
    + Please begin with the following sentence: `I would like to submit # new items for consideration.` 
    + If your number of new items to suggest is zero, then you need not write anything else here. 
    + Should you wish to have us include 1-3 additional items, please remember that nothing about sex, drugs, or performance in 431 can be asked, and:
        a. list each new item, being sure to specify the type (for instance, short answer, multiple choice, or checkbox) and the set of possible responses, as you did in the proposal.
        b. describe (in 2-3 complete sentences per new item) your reasons to include the item. 
            - Good reasons would begin with a statement of what you intend to do. As an example of such a statement, consider `I wish to study the result of this new item as a quantitative outcome across groups established by current item #*** from the survey.` Or, perhaps, something like: `I wish to use this new item as a grouping variable to study current item #***.` 
            - In either case, follow your statement with a short explanation as to why your new item's result is of interest, and is not already captured by the existing survey.
