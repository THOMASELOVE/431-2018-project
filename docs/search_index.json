Love 2018-09-08 11:42:07 Chapter 1 Overview Your final project for this course will result in a portfolio of work related to two studies. [Study 1 - the Class Survey] In the first study, you (sometimes working individually, sometimes in a group of students) will design, administer, analyze and present the results of a survey designed to compare two or three groups of subjects on some categorical and continuous outcomes we will develop from your initial ideas. [Study 2 - your Data] In the second study, you (working individually) will propose a research question and relevant data of interest to you, and then complete all elements of a data science project designed to create a statistical model for a quantitative outcome, then use it for prediction and assess the quality of those predictions. All materials related to the project will be maintained at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project where regular updates will be posted throughout the semester. "],

["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!
