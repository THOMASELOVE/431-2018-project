Your final project for this course will result in a portfolio of work
related to two studies.

\textbf{Study 1 - Class Survey}. In the first study, you (sometimes
working individually, sometimes in a group) will design, administer,
analyze and present the results of a survey designed to compare two or
three groups of subjects on some \emph{categorical} and
\emph{quantitative} outcomes we will develop from your initial ideas.

\textbf{Study 2 - Your Data}. In the second study, you (working
individually) will propose a research question and relevant data of
interest to you, and then complete all elements of a data science
project designed to create a statistical model for a \emph{quantitative}
outcome, then use it for prediction and assess the quality of those
predictions.

\chapter{Project Objectives}\label{project-objectives}}

It is hard to learn statistics (or anything else) passively; concurrent
theory and application are essential\footnote{Though by no means an
  original idea, this particular phrasing is stolen from Harry Roberts.}.

\hypertarget{study-1-is-about-making-comparisons-and-visualizing-groups-of-data.}{%
\section{Study 1 is about making comparisons and visualizing groups of
data.}\label{study-1-is-about-making-comparisons-and-visualizing-groups-of-data.}}

\textbf{Study 1} involves data from a \textbf{class survey}, to be
conducted in October. We will design, administer, analyze and present
survey results designed to compare two or three groups of subjects from
the class on some \emph{categorical} and \emph{quantitative} outcomes.
In the analysis stage, everyone will be working with different parts of
the same data set.

\begin{quote}
Think of a graph as a comparison. All graphs are comparisons (indeed,
all statistical analyses are comparisons). If you already have the graph
in mind, think of what comparisons it's enabling. Or if you haven't
settled on the graph yet, think of what comparisons you'd like to make.
\href{http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/25/statistical-graphics-course-statistical-graphics-advice/}{Andrew
Gelman}
\end{quote}

In your eventual analysis of Study 1, you will be comparing both
quantitative and categorical outcomes across 2-3 groups. All tools
necessary for Study 1 are in Parts A and B of the course, and include
the following\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Descriptive and exploratory summaries of the data across the groups
  for each of your chosen outcomes, including, of course, attractive and
  well-constructed visualizations, graphs and tables.
\item
  Comparisons of the population mean difference for at least one
  quantitative outcome across a set of two (or three) groups, including
  appropriate demonstrations of the reasons behind the choices you made
  between parametric, non-parametric and bootstrap procedures.
\item
  Comparisons of the population proportions for at least one categorical
  outcome across your set of two (or three) groups, including
  appropriately interpreted point estimates and confidence intervals.
\end{itemize}

Note well that Study 1 is \textbf{not} about building sophisticated
statistical models, and using them to make predictions. That's Study 2.

\hypertarget{study-2-is-about-building-a-model-and-making-predictions.}{%
\section{Study 2 is about building a model, and making
predictions.}\label{study-2-is-about-building-a-model-and-making-predictions.}}

\textbf{Study 2} involves data about a \textbf{research question that
you will propose}, involving data of interest to you. Thus, everyone
will be working with a different data set. You will complete all
elements of a data science project designed to create a statistical
model for a \emph{quantitative} outcome, then use it for prediction, and
assess the quality of those predictions.

\begin{quote}
All models are wrong but some are useful.
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong}{George E. P.
Box}
\end{quote}

In Study 2, you will be building a multiple linear regression model, and
using it to predict a quantitative outcome of interest. The tools
necessary for Study 2 appear in each Part of the course, especially Part
C, and include the following\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Describing the experimental or observational study design used to
  gather the data, as well as the complete data collection process.
\item
  Sharing the complete raw data in an appropriate way with a
  statistician (Dr.~Love). This means that, in general, data including
  protected health information are \emph{not} appropriate for this
  project.
\item
  Developing appropriate research questions that lead to the
  identification of smart measures for predictors and outcomes, and then
  the development of a prediction model using multiple linear
  regression.
\item
  Using a training sample to develop a model, and present the process
  that leads to a final set of 2-3 candidate models in the training
  sample.
\item
  Using a test sample to evaluate the quality of predictions from each
  of the candidate models, and making a final selection.
\item
  Evaluating the adherence of the data you've collected to the
  assumptions of multiple linear regression, and iterating through the
  model-building process as necessary until the final model shows no
  strong violations of those assumptions.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{why-two-studies}{%
\section{Why Two Studies?}\label{why-two-studies}}

The main reason is that I can't figure out a way to get you to think
about all of the things I hope you'll learn from this project in a
single study.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  I set different tasks for Study 1 and for Study 2, allowing us to
  touch on a wider fraction of the things I hope you'll learn in 431.
\item
  I want some of the work to be done as a class, some in groups, some as
  individuals.
\item
  Some of you have easy access to great data you want to study in this
  class, and in fact, that's a primary motivation for taking the class.
  But not all of you.
\item
  I have to evaluate each of your projects, and there are many students
  in the class. Knowing at least one of the data sets you'll be working
  with helps me manage this.
\item
  Having a broad range of activities to evaluate helps reduce the cost
  of a mistake on any one of them, so that we can build on what you do
  well.
\item
  All of Study 1 can be done by the middle of November, leaving the last
  few weeks of the semester for you to focus on Study 2.
\end{enumerate}

demonstrate:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

\item
  The ability to create and formulate research questions that are
  statistically and scientifically appropriate.

  \href{https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing}{Jeff Leek's guide to
  sharing data with a statistician}.
\item
  The ability to identify appropriate estimation / testing procedures
  for the class survey using both continuous and categorical outcomes.
\item
  The ability to build a reasonable model, including interactions and
  transformations to deal with non-linearity, assess the quality of the
  model and residual plots, then use the model to make predictions.
\item
  The ability to build a Table 1 to showcase potential differences
  between variables.
\item
  The ability to identify and (with help) solve problems that crop up
\item
  The ability to comment on your work within code, and in written and
  oral presentation.
\item
  The ability to build a Markdown-based report and a Markdown-based set
  of slides for presentation.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{taskA}{%
\chapter{Task A (The Proposal) Instructions}\label{taskA}}

Task A requires you to accomplish the following:

On 2018-09-25, you will become part of a \textbf{group} of about five
people, and your group will:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  develop and propose 2-3 ``research questions'' for Study 1 (The Class
  Survey). Here, your research questions must clearly identify
  meaningful statistical comparisons.
\item
  propose 6-10 ``homemade'' survey questions for Study 1 that relate to
  your research questions, and
\item
  propose a ``scale'' for Study 1 that also relates to your research
  questions.
\end{enumerate}

As an \textbf{individual}, you will also:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  develop and propose a meaningful summary of your ideas and research
  question for Study 2 (Your Data). Your research question needs to
  clearly relate to modeling and prediction of a quantitative outcome on
  the basis of a set of predictor variables.
\item
  identify and present a detailed description of a data set that is
  likely to lead to an answer to the research question proposed for
  Study 2, and that is appropriate for use in this project.
\end{enumerate}

The rest of this section contains guidance as to what sort of questions
your group will need to propose for the class survey in Study 1, and as
to what sorts of data sets and research questions are appropriate for
your Study 2 proposal.

\hypertarget{deadline-and-submission-information}{%
\section{Deadline and Submission
information}\label{deadline-and-submission-information}}

The project groups will only apply to Project Tasks A, C and D. You will
become part of a project group on 2018-09-25 and the groups will disband
after the survey is finalized in late October.

Task A is due at noon on 2018-10-15. (\textbf{Note the change of date.})
You will submit your Task A work through
\href{https://canvas.case.edu/}{Canvas}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The group work (Parts 1-3) need to be submitted by one of the members
  of your group.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If you are not the person submitting this information for your
    group, then your Task A submission should begin with the statement:
    ``Parts 1-3 of Task A were submitted for my group by PERSON'S
    NAME.''
  \end{itemize}
\item
  All students need to submit Parts 4 and 5 of Task A, individually. You
  can do this in advance of your group's submission of Parts 1-3 if you
  like.
\item
  Please note that \textbf{Task A and Task B} are no longer due at the
  same time. Task B is due 2018-10-12, but Task A is now due 2018-10-15.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{study-1-work-for-task-a}{%
\section{Study 1 work for Task A}\label{study-1-work-for-task-a}}

In Study 1, you will survey your fellow students through an online
instrument (containing somewhere around 100 items) that we will develop
in Tasks A, C and D in September and October and then administer in the
final week of October (Task E).

Students in the class will develop the items for this instrument in 10
groups of about 5 people per group. The final survey will include
questions generated by each of the 10 groups in the class.

The course survey will be done online, and the respondents
(de-identified, of course) will include all students in the current 431
class, plus the teaching assistants, and perhaps some volunteers from
previous iterations of the course, in an effort to get a reasonable (but
by no means random or representative) sample of graduate students at
CWRU.

Remember that Study 1 is about making comparisons between groups.

\hypertarget{research-questions}{%
\subsection{Research Questions}\label{research-questions}}

The first part of Task A requires your group to develop and propose 2-3
``research questions'' for Study 1 (The Class Survey).

\begin{quote}
A research question is the fundamental core of a research project,
study, or review of literature. It focuses the study, determines the
methodology, and guides all stages of inquiry, analysis, and reporting.
\href{https://researchrundowns.com/intro/writing-research-questions/}{Source}
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The research questions your project group will prepare for Study 1
  should state the study objective in terms that allow us to apply
  statistical methods to test data to obtain an answer.
\item
  Each research question should be written in the form of a comparison
  of 2-3 exposures or groups in terms of an outcome.
\item
  At least one of your research questions needs to compare groups on a
  quantitative outcome, and at least one needs to compare groups on a
  categorical outcome (containing no more than 5 categories.)
\end{itemize}

Quoting Roger Peng, from
\href{https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/}{Exploratory Data Analysis
with R}:

\begin{quote}
Formulating a question can be a useful way to guide the exploratory data
analysis process and to limit the exponential number of paths that can
be taken with any sizeable dataset. In particular, a sharp question or
hypothesis can serve as a dimension reduction tool that can eliminate
variables that are not immediately relevant to the question. For
example, (suppose that we are interested in) looking at an air pollution
dataset from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
A general question one could ask is ``Are air pollution levels higher on
the east coast than on the west coast?'' But a more specific question
might be ``Are hourly ozone levels on average higher in New York City
than they are in Los Angeles?''
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Note that both questions may be of interest, and neither is right or
wrong. But the first question requires looking at all pollutants across
the entire east and west coasts, while the second question only requires
looking at single pollutant in two cities. It's usually a good idea to
spend a few minutes to figure out what is the question you're really
interested in, and narrow it down to be as specific as possible (without
becoming uninteresting).
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{research-questions-that-have-worked-in-the-past}{%
\subsection{Research Questions that have worked in the
past}\label{research-questions-that-have-worked-in-the-past}}

For Study 1, your research questions will need to compare two or more
exposure groups on a quantitative outcome (in one case) and on a
categorical outcome (in another case). Here are several examples that
worked in the past:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``Do messy people tend to have higher levels of self-described
  creativity than organized people?''
\item
  ``Is whether you voted in the last presidential election strongly
  associated with your level of interest in the current election?''
\item
  ``Does being in a committed romantic relationship result in higher
  self-esteem compared to not being in a committed romantic
  relationship?''
\item
  ``Do conscientious people spend more time every week engaged in
  activities, such as exercise, thought to promote health and well-being
  compared to others?''
\item
  ``Do graduate students who routinely pack their lunch have a lower BMI
  than graduate students who routinely purchase their lunch?''
\item
  ``Do individuals who spend a lot of time on social media each day have
  more or less social anxiety than those who do not?''
\end{itemize}

Don't boil the ocean here. You're looking for a research question that
can be reasonably addressed in a survey of approximately 50 people, so
it has to be pretty straightforward.

\hypertarget{checklist-for-research-questions}{%

\item
  Is our research question (RQ) something that we are curious about and

\item
  Is our RQ too broad, too narrow, or OK, given the time frame and
  restrictions of this survey?
\item
  Is our RQ measurable? What type of information do we need? Can I find
  a way to ask a limited number of survey questions in such a way to
  allow me to (after the data are collected) either support or
  contradict a position on my RQ?

\hypertarget{specifying-survey-questions}{%
\subsection{Specifying Survey
Questions}\label{specifying-survey-questions}}

The second part of Task A requires your group to develop and propose
6-10 ``homemade'' survey questions for Study 1 that relate to your
research questions.

Your group will need to specify the exact wording for your survey
questions (and potential answers for any categorical responses.) This
will likely require some editing and rework, once we have the complete
set of proposed questions from all students. Be prepared to revise and
resubmit, quickly, so that all items can be resolved in time for
publication of the draft survey.

Of your 6-10 survey questions \ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  at least two should ask the respondents to provide you with a
  \textbf{number} that expresses a quantitative outcome of interest to
  you, and these outcomes should relate closely to at least one of your
  research questions.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If you are asking people to respond to a prompt using a rating, that
    rating should be expressed on a wide scale. Our preference is a
    0-100 scale for quantitative items, where 0 represents the most
    negative reaction and 100 the most positive reaction to the item.
  \item
    One common choice is to make a statement and ask for agreement with
    that statement on a scale from 0 = Strongly Disagree to 100 =
    Strongly Agree.
  \item
    The reason we prefer a 0-100 scale is to increase variation in our
    responses, as compared to, say, a 1-10 scale.
  \item
    When responding to items using a scale like this on the actual
    survey, please use the whole scale.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{at least two} should ask the respondents to provide you with a
  response that expresses a categorical outcome of interest to you, and
  these, too, should relate to at least one of your research questions.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    You will need to specify each of the available responses that you
    wish to use in the survey.
  \item
    No more than five options for your categorical outcome, please.
  \item
    The response options you specify should be mutually exclusive and
    collectively exhaustive.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{at least two} should ask the respondents to categorize
  themselves into one of two (or three) groups.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Be aware that you will need to have at least 10 students in each
    group in order to build a semi-reasonable analysis.
  \item
    You should expect that 50-55 people will actually respond to the
    survey, in total.
  \item
    Again, these groupings should be linked to your research questions.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

You are welcome to submit exactly 6, or as many as 10 total survey
questions in this part of the Task. It is likely that some of your
survey questions will not correspond to some of your research questions,
and that's OK, but each survey question should be linked to at least one
of your research questions.

\hypertarget{dr.love-will-include-15-survey-questions-automatically}{%
\subsubsection{Dr.~Love will include 15 Survey Questions
Automatically}\label{dr.love-will-include-15-survey-questions-automatically}}

The following items will be included in the survey to identify
``groups'' of students in a reasonable way. As a result, you should not
ask these questions in your proposed list, although you can and should
consider whether these groupings would be good candidates for
application to your research questions.

The following 7 items will have yes/no responses, and thus produce
binary groups for analysis.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Were you born in the United States?
\item
  Is English the language you speak better than any other?
\item
  Do you identify as female?
\item
  Do you wear prescription glasses or contact lenses?
\item
  Before taking 431, had you ever used R before?
\item
  Are you currently married or in a stable domestic relationship?
\item
  Have you smoked 100 cigarettes or more in your entire life?
\end{enumerate}

The next eight items generate non-binary responses. Together, after the
survey is complete, we will identify ``cutpoints'' for these eight items
to identify groups of meaningful size.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{7}
\tightlist
\item
  In what year were you born?
\item
  How would you rate your current health overall (Excellent, Very Good,
  Good, Fair, Poor)
\item
  For how long, in months, have you lived in Northeast Ohio?
\item
  What is your height in inches? (If you are five feet, eight inches
  tall, please write 68 inches. To convert from centimeters to inches,
  multiply your height in centimeters by 0.3937, and then round the
  result to the nearest inch.)
\item
  What is your weight in pounds? (To convert from kilograms to pounds,
  multiply your weight in kilograms by 2.2046, and then round the result
  to the nearest pound.)
\item
  What is your pulse rate, in beats per minute? (Please either use a
  tracking device, or count your pulse for 15 seconds then multiply by
  4)
\item
  Last week, on how many days did you exercise? (0 - 7)
\item
  Last night, how many hours of sleep did you get?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{permitted-types-of-items}{%
\subsubsection{Permitted Types of
Items}\label{permitted-types-of-items}}

The survey will be conducted using a Google Form, rather than Survey
Monkey or some other tool. Thus, we have a somewhat restricted set of
item types.

For \textbf{quantitative measures}, Google Forms permit the use of

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  a \emph{short answer} item without any restrictions on the response
  (except a character limit)
\item
  a \emph{short answer} item where respondents are forced to insert a
  number within a given range through a validation process that only
  accepts the response if it falls within the specified limits.
\item
  \emph{linear scale} items for ordered categorical ratings (but only on
  a scale of up to ten points - i.e.~1 to 10)
\end{enumerate}

For \textbf{categorical measures}, Google Forms permit the use of

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{multiple choice} items for endorsing a single choice from a
  group of 2-10 alternatives.
\item
  \emph{checkbox} items for the endorsement of one or more choices from
  a group of 2-10 alternatives.
\item
  \emph{linear scale} items for ordered categorical ratings (often on a
  1-X scale, where X is between 2 and 10)
\item
  \emph{dropdown} items for selections of one option from a group of 2-3
  choices.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{old-class-surveys}{%

Remember that the rules used this year have been modified from what has
been used for the project previously.

\hypertarget{specifying-a-scale}{%
\subsection{Specifying a ``Scale''}\label{specifying-a-scale}}

The third part of Task A requires your group to identify and propose a
``scale'' of items for Study 1 (The Class Survey).

Your group needs to specify a published scale (available for free public
use) to generate an outcome or grouping(s) of interest from those
completing the survey. You will have to provide a complete reference to
the scale (online, ideally) and specify each of the items in the scale,
and how the scale is then evaluated, in all necessary detail to allow us
to review and replicate the scale in practice.

The word ``scale'' is used in many different ways. In this case, by a
scale I mean a published list of items, usually accompanied by a scoring
rubric that provides some sort of composite score or scores. Examples of
scales we have used in the past include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Two \href{https://chirr.nlm.nih.gov/health-orientation.php}{Health
  Consciousness Scales}, one due to Gould another to Dutta-Bregman
  \href{https://chirr.nlm.nih.gov/health-orientation.php}{Gould Health
  Consciousness Scale}
\item
  The
  \href{https://gosling.psy.utexas.edu/scales-weve-developed/ten-item-personality-measure-tipi/ten-item-personality-inventory-tipi/}{Ten-Item
  Personality Inventory}
\item
  The
  \href{https://das.nh.gov/wellness/Docs/Percieved\%20Stress\%20Scale.pdf}{Perceived

\item
  The
  \href{https://www.sleepapnea.org/assets/files/pdf/ESS\%20PDF\%201990-97.pdf}{Epworth
  Sleepiness Scale}
\end{itemize}

Your group will need to verify explicitly in your Task A materials that
the scale your group proposes is freely available for use by anyone,
without any fees or registration requirements.

\hypertarget{study-2-work-for-task-a}{%
\section{Study 2 Work for Task A}\label{study-2-work-for-task-a}}

You, individually, will present a proposal \textbf{summary} (\textless{}
300 words) and a brief \textbf{data description} for Study 2 in Task A.

You will be building a multiple linear regression model, and using it to
predict your outcome of interest.

\hypertarget{the-proposal-summary}{%
\subsection{The Proposal Summary}\label{the-proposal-summary}}

The fourth part of Task A is to develop and propose a meaningful summary
of your ideas and research question for Study 2 (Your Data).

Your summary should begin with a title for your Study 2. Take the time
to come up with a good, interesting title. You are going to work hard on
this thing; please resist the temptation to kill my interest at the
start by calling it ``431 Statistics Project'' or anything else that
shows a similar lack of effort.

Provide me a very brief summary of what you're trying to accomplish -
specifically, what your research question is, and what you hypothesize
will happen.

The five most important things to do in the summary are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Write clearly. My best advice is to finish the summary as soon as you
  can, and then give it to someone else to read, who can criticize it
  for lack of clarity in the writing.
\item
  Specify the topic of interest, and motivate your study of it.
\item
  Explicitly specify your key research question, which should be stated
  as a question, and which should clearly and naturally lead to a
  prediction model for a quantitative outcome.
\item
  Explain what you hypothesize will happen, and
\item
  Explicitly link your key research question to the data set you
  describe in your data description.
\end{enumerate}

The summary is the heart of the proposal, and requires some care. You
will need to convince me that your topic is interesting, your data are
relevant, and building a model and making predictions of a quantitative
outcome using the predictors available to you will be worthwhile.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The summary ends with a statement of the research question or
  questions (you may have one, or possibly two.) An excellent question
  conveys the main objective of the study in terms that allow us to
  apply statistical models to describe an association between one or
  more predictors and a quantitative outcome. Some advice on writing a
  good research question is provided below, after the data set
  description information.
\item
  It should be possible for me to explain your study accurately just by
  reading this summary. If it's not possible, it will come back to you
  for a REDO. Statistics is a details business. Get the details right.
\item
  This summary should be less than 300 words.
\item
  Use complete English sentences. Write in plain language. Use words we
  all know. Avoid jargon. And
  \href{https://thomaselove.github.io/2018-431-syllabus/a-few-general-writingpresenting-tips.html}{look
  at the general suggestions about writing in the Course Syllabus}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-data-description}{%
\subsection{The Data Description}\label{the-data-description}}

Your data description can be as long as it needs to be, although two
pages is usually more than enough. It should include:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Your data source, which can be an online source (in which case include
  a working link), a published paper or journal article (in which case I
  need a link and a PDF copy of the paper), or unpublished data (in
  which case I need the details of how the data were gathered).
\item
  A thorough description of the data collection process, with complete
  details as to the nature of the variables, the setting for data
  collection, and complete details of any apparatus you used which may
  affect results.
\item
  Specification of the people and methods involved.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Who are the subjects under study?
  \item
    When were the data gathered? By whom?
  \item
    How many subjects are included?
  \item
    What caused subjects to be included or excluded from the study?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Your planned \textbf{quantitative} outcome, which must relate directly
  to the research question you specified above. Provide a complete
  definition, including specifying the exact wording of the question or
  details of the measurement procedure used to obtain the outcome. If
  available, you can also include descriptions of secondary
  \textbf{quantitative} outcomes. Your outcomes must be quantitative in
  Study 2.
\item
  Your predictors of interest, which should also relate to the research
  question in an obvious way. Again, define the variables carefully, as
  you did with the outcome.
\item
  If you already have the data, tell me that. If you don't, specify any
  steps you must still take in order to get the data, and specify the
  date by which you will have your data (must be no later than November
  1.)
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{data-restrictions}{%
\subsection{Data Restrictions}\label{data-restrictions}}

Study 2 data sets MUST

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  contain between 250 and 250,000 distinct observations,
\item
  contain at least one quantitative outcome variable,
\item
  contain at least four predictor variables, one of which may be
  identified as the ``key'' predictor of interest,
\item
  include at least one quantitative predictor variable, and at least one
  categorical predictor variable,
\item
  include a complete description of how the data were gathered, so that
  information must be publicly available,
\item
  be in your hands no later than November 1,
\item
  be shared with a statistician (Dr.~Love) following
  \href{https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing}{Jeff Leek's guide to
  sharing data with a statistician} as part of Task F. This means you
  need to have access to the data in the raw, and it means that I have
  to be able to have access to it in the raw, as well. - be capable of
  being fully cited for any and all data elements, including a complete
  codebook, as this must be provided as part of your proposal.
\end{itemize}

While there are some great resources available to some people in this
class by virtue of their affiliation with one of the health systems in
town, I can do nothing to get you access to health system specific data
as part of your project for this class or for 432, and in general, data
from those sources are not especially appropriate because of issues with
protected health information.

No more than two students in the class can work on the same question for
the same data. If two of you have data you would each like to work on,
that may be OK, but you'll need to generate separate research questions
and perform your analyses and the Project Tasks separately.

I am not interested in you using pre-cleaned data from an educational
repository, such as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Don't use hierarchical, multi-level data. That's not what we need in
  431.
\item
  Don't use a categorical outcome variable, or plan a logistic
  regression model. That's for 432, not 431.
\item
  Don't assume Dr.~Love knows anything at all about wet lab biology work
  or genomics.
\item
  If you are planning to use data you have collected, or that you are
  working on as part of another course or your research work, that is
  probably going to work out better in 432 than 431. At a minimum, you
  will need to be able to convince me that the data you will provide is
  completely free of any restrictions (after de-identification and
  compliance with all HIPAA and other security standards), contains NO
  protected information of any kind, and can be shared freely with the
  general public. You will need to write a statement asserting that all
  of this is true for me to approve your proposal.

\section{Research Questions for Study 2 that worked well in the
past}\label{research-questions-for-study-2-that-worked-well-in-the-past}}

For Study 2, your research questions will need to fit within the
confines of a regression model, where a quantitative outcome is
predicted using a series of at least four predictor variables. In many
cases, a key predictor will be of primary interest, with other
predictors serving to ``adjust'' away noise and generate fairer
comparisons. Here are a few examples from past classes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``Is the presence of cardiovascular risk factors, specifically
  elevated hemoglobin A1c, predictive of cognitive impairment as defined
  by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test in patients over the age of 60
  years, after adjusting for age, education, and depression?''
\item
  ``What is the effect of thyroid dysfunction on LDL level after
  adjusting for age, sex, and level of physical activity in the
  population of patients at XXXXXXXX location who are 40 years-old and
  above?''
\item
  ``Do conscientiousness and openness predict more conservative or
  liberal attitudes about government spending and whether and how much
  wasteful spending exists, after accounting for age, income and
  professional status?''
\item
  ``Does overweight or obesity (defined by body mass index) predict
  insulin resistance (measured by the homeostasis model assessment of
  insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)) in young adults with first-time acute
  coronary syndrome after adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity and
  severity of (several comorbid conditions)?''
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{evaluating-task-a}{%
\section{Evaluating Task A}\label{evaluating-task-a}}

Dr.~Love will evaluate all proposals (Task A) personally, in the order
in which they are received. Proposals will receive one of two grades: OK
or REDO. That grade will be posted to Canvas. REDO will be accompanied
with specific requests in the form of a Canvas comment that should be
accomplished within a short time window (approximately 24 hours). If you
materially deviate from these specifications, Dr.~Love will not evaluate
your proposal other than to re-specify what needs to be fixed before he
will respond.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A score of OK is worth 10/10 points for Task A, once Task B is also
  complete.
\item
  You (and/or your group, if there are problems with parts 1-3) must
  REDO the Proposal until you reach OK. Sometimes, that's more than
  once.

Task C is due at noon on 2018-10-23. Submit your Task C work via
\href{https://canvas.case.edu/}{Canvas}. Please note that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Task D is also due at the same time.
\item
  We do not have class on 2018-10-23 because of CWRU's Fall Break.

Dr.~Love will make the Draft Survey available as soon as possible after
our initial work developing the Survey is complete.

\hypertarget{task-c-has-two-parts.}{%
\section{Task C has two parts.}\label{task-c-has-two-parts.}}

In Task C, you need to submit a single Word document (maximum one page,
12 point font, with your name and Project Task C on the top of the Word
document) containing the following two things:

\hypertarget{a-list-of-corrections-and-clarifications-to-the-existing-items-in-the-draft-survey.}{%
\subsection{A list of corrections and clarifications to the existing

This should include any typographical errors, clarifications or other
edits that you wish to suggest for the items included in the Draft
Survey.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If you found no errors or items in need of clarification, write a
  sentence saying that.
\item
  If you did find an issue, please be sure to specify the item number
  where you feel a revision is needed.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{An Important Note}: In addition, If you see any items in the
Draft Survey that you, personally, are not comfortable answering, for
whatever reason, \textbf{please indicate that to us} in your response
here, and we will consider revisions appropriately.

to the Draft
Survey.}\label{a-list-of-0-3-new-items-that-you-want-us-to-consider-adding-to-the-draft-survey.}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Note that your new items \emph{can} be but do not \emph{need} to be
  anything you've previously suggested.
\item
  Please begin with the following sentence:
  \texttt{I\ would\ like\ to\ submit\ \#\ new\ items\ for\ consideration.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If your number of new items to suggest is zero, then you need not
    write anything else here. - Should you wish to have us include 1-3
    additional items, remember that nothing about sex, drugs, or
    performance in 431 can be asked.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

For each new item you propose\ldots{}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  list the complete wording of the new item, being sure to specify the
  type (for instance, short answer, multiple choice, or checkbox) and
  the set of possible responses, as you did in Task A.
\item
  describe (in 2-3 complete sentences per new item) your reasons to
  include the item.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Good reasons would begin with a statement of what you intend to do.
    As an example of such a statement, consider
    \texttt{I\ wish\ to\ study\ the\ result\ of\ this\ new\ item\ as\ a\ quantitative\ outcome\ across\ groups\ established\ by\ current\ item\ \#***\ from\ the\ survey.}
    Or, perhaps, something like:
    \texttt{I\ wish\ to\ use\ this\ new\ item\ as\ a\ grouping\ variable\ to\ study\ current\ item\ \#***.}
  \item
    In either case, follow your statement with a short explanation as to
    why your new item's result is of interest, and is not already
    captured by the existing survey.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

We will not consider more than 3 new items from anyone, and are eager to
hold the total set of new items to 20 or less, across all 51 students. I
hope that data related to each of the accepted project proposals will be
found in the Draft Survey, as that is certainly the intention. So if
that's the case, we are unlikely to need more than a few new items.

\subsection{Analysis 1: Comparing the Means of Two
Populations}\label{analysis-1-comparing-the-means-of-two-populations}}

Here, you will choose either to use a paired samples design or an
independent samples design.

If you're using paired samples (to do Analysis 1a), then you will
specify

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Outcome A, a quantitative variable, and
\item
  Outcome B, also a quantitative variable.
\end{itemize}

If you're using \textbf{independent} samples (to do Analysis 1b), then
you will specify

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Outcome C, a quantitative variable, and
\item
  Factor Z, a two-level categorical variable
\end{itemize}

Each level of your Factor Z must apply to a minimum of 10 subjects in
the Survey.

\hypertarget{analysis-2-comparing-the-means-of-three-or-more-populations}{%
\subsection{Analysis 2: Comparing the Means of Three or More
Populations}\label{analysis-2-comparing-the-means-of-three-or-more-populations}}

Here, you will complete an analysis of variance, with pre-planned Tukey
HSD comparisons. You will specify:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Outcome D, a quantitative variable (which can repeat A, B or C from
  before if you like)
\item
  Factor Y, a 3-6 level categorical variable
\end{itemize}

Each level of your Factor Y must apply to a minimum of 6 subjects in the
Survey.

\hypertarget{analysis-3-regression-model-with-one-covariate}{%
\subsection{Analysis 3: Regression Model with One
Covariate}\label{analysis-3-regression-model-with-one-covariate}}

Here, you will use the same outcome and factor as you used in either
Analysis 1 (if you used independent samples) or Analysis 2, but add a
new covariate. So you will specify:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Outcome E, which must be the same as either your Outcome C (if you're
  amplifying Analysis 1b) or Outcome D (if you're amplifying Analysis
  2).
\item
  Factor X, which must be the same as either Factor Z (if you're
  amplifying Analysis 1b) or Factor Y (if you're amplifying Analysis 2),
  but now you're also adding:
\item
  Covariate G, which is to be a quantitative variable not used in
  Analyses 1 or 2.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{analysis-4-comparing-two-population-proportions}{%
\subsection{Analysis 4: Comparing Two Population
Proportions}\label{analysis-4-comparing-two-population-proportions}}

Here, you will develop and analyze a 2x2 contingency table. You will
specify:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Factor L (which needs to have exactly 2 levels) and will be in the
  rows of your table, and
\item
  Factor M (which also needs to have exactly 2 levels) and be in the
  columns.
\end{itemize}

Every cell in your 2x2 table needs to have at least 5 observations. You
are welcome to re-use a two-level factor you've used in a previous
Analysis for L or M, but must add a new factor for the other.

\hypertarget{analysis-5-a-larger-two-way-table}{%
\subsection{Analysis 5: A Larger Two-Way
Table}\label{analysis-5-a-larger-two-way-table}}

Here, you will develop a contingency table analysis to describe (in the
rows) a factor with 2-6 levels, and (in the columns) a factor with 3-6
levels. You will specify:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Factor J (which must have 2-6 levels) and will be in the rows of this
  table, and
\item
  Factor K (which must have 3-6 levels) and will be in the columns
\end{itemize}

You can re-use at most one of Factors L and M as Factor J, but Factor K
must be new.

\hypertarget{analysis-6-comparing-population-proportions-in-a-2x2xn-contingency-table}{%
\subsection{Analysis 6: Comparing Population Proportions in a 2x2xN
contingency
table}\label{analysis-6-comparing-population-proportions-in-a-2x2xn-contingency-table}}

Here, you will amplify Analysis 4 by developing a Mantel-Haenszel
analysis of a contingency table with 2 rows (re-using Factor L from
Analysis 4), 2 columns (re-using Factor M from Analysis 4) and 3-6
layers (or strata) in a new factor called Factor N. You will specify:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Factor N (which must have 3-6 levels) and can repeat Factor J or K if
  you like, so long as it is different from Factors L or M.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{backups}{%
\subsection{Backups}\label{backups}}

You will also specify

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Quantitative Variable Q: a backup quantitative variable for use as an
  outcome
\item
  Quantitative Variable R: another backup quantitative variable, just in
  case
\item
  Factor Variable S: a backup 2 level categorical variable for use as a
  group
\item
  Factor Variable T: a backup 3-6 level categorical variable for use as
  a group, and
\end{itemize}

These backups are for whether the results of the Survey turn out to
yield either outcome variables with no variation at all across the
groups of interest (in Analyses 1-3) or tables with insufficiently
populated cells (in Analysis 4-6).

    and its values in your .csv file,
  \item
    a \textbf{study design} section which reminds (and updates) us about
    the source of the data and your research question.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

If you must zip the raw data set, OK, but include the tidy CSV and
Word/PDF files as separate documents, apart from the zip file you
submit. The details for these elements of Task F follow.

\hypertarget{the-raw-data-set}{%
\section{The Raw Data Set}\label{the-raw-data-set}}

You need to show me the raw, de-identified data. What does this mean?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The data set should be as you ``received'' it, \textbf{other} than the
  following:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The ``raw'' data set must be completely de-identified, likely by
    removing any columns containing identifiable information.
  \item
    The ``raw'' data you post should include no protected health
    information, nor should it include anything you are not 100\% sure
    you can share with Dr.~Love.
  \item
    The ``raw'' data set must include a unique id code for each subject,
    and that can be generated by you if the original data contained
    identifiable information within its id codes.
  \item
    The ``raw'' data set may in fact be multiple data sets, which you
    will merge together to form your eventual, tidy, analytic data set.
  \item
    The ``raw'' data set must include all variables you will or might
    use in your project analyses, but you are permitted to delete any
    variables (columns) that you are 100\% sure will NOT be used in your
    analyses. Note that you should include any variables that you
    haven't made a final decision on.
  \item
    The ``raw'' data set should indicate all missing values as they were
    originally provided to you. Do not impute missing values in the
    ``raw'' data set.
  \item
    You should not summarize the raw data in any way, nor should you
    delete any rows.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

A direct link (without me having to sign up for anything) to an
appropriate raw data file(s) is preferred, if possible. If this is not
possible, then describe the original source(s) of the data carefully,
and send instead a .csv file or (files) of the raw data set, called
\texttt{yourname-raw.csv}\footnote{If you have to send more than one
  ``raw'' .csv data set, append numbers after each name, so you'd submit
  \texttt{yourname-raw1.csv}, \texttt{yourname-raw2.csv} etc.}

\hypertarget{the-tidy-data-set}{%
\section{The Tidy Data Set}\label{the-tidy-data-set}}

Your tidy .csv file should include only those variables you will
actually use in your analysis of Study 2. Your .csv file should include
one row per subject in your data, and one column for each variable you
will use. Your data are tidy if each variable you measure is in its own
column, and each different observation of that variable is in its own
row, identifed by the subject identification code in the left-most
column, which you might call \texttt{Subj\_ID} if that's helpful.

You need to provide:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  a header row (row 1 in the spreadsheet) that contains full row names.
  So if you measured age at diagnosis for patients, you would head that
  column with the name \texttt{AgeAtDiagnosis} or
  \texttt{Age\_at\_Diagnosis} instead of something like \texttt{ADx} or
  another abbreviation that may be hard for another person (or you, two
  years from now) to understand.
\item
  a study identification number (I would call this variable
  \texttt{Subj\_ID} and use consecutive integers to represent the rows
  in your data set) which should be the left-most variable in your tidy
  data.
\item
  a quantitative outcome with a meaningful name using no special
  characters other than an underscore (\texttt{\_}) used to separate
  words, which should be the second variable in your data.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If you have any missing \textbf{outcome} values, \textbf{delete
    those rows} entirely from your tidy data set before submitting it.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  at least four predictor variables, each with a meaningful name using
  no special characters other than \texttt{\_} to separate words, and
  the predictors should be shown in columns to the right of the outcome.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{Continuous} variables are anything measured on a quantitative
    scale that could be any fractional number.
  \item
    \emph{Ordinal categorical} data are data that have a fixed, small
    (\textless{} 100) number of levels but are ordered.
  \item
    \emph{Nominal categorical} data are data where there are multiple
    categories, but they aren't ordered.
  \item
    Categorical predictors should read into R as factors, so your
    categories should include letters, and not just numbers. In general,
    try to avoid coding nominal or ordinal categorical variables as
    numbers.
  \item
    Label your categorical predictors in the way you plan to use them in
    your analyses.
  \item
    \emph{Missing data} are data that are missing and you don't know the
    mechanism. Missing data in the predictor variables are allowed, and
    you should code missing values in your tidy data set as \texttt{NA}.
    It is critical to report if there is a reason you know about that
    some of the data are missing.
  \item
    Note that you should \textbf{not} impute any data in Project Task F.
    Instead, you will impute as part of your analysis and demonstrate
    that in Tasks G and H, as necessary.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  any other variables you need to share with me (typically this would
  only include things you had to use in order to get to your final
  choice of outcome and predictors.) Most people will not need to share
  any additional variables.
\end{enumerate}

I will need to be able to take your submitted tidy \texttt{.csv} file
and run your eventual Markdown file (part of
\protect\hyperlink{taskG}{Task G}) against it and obtain your results,
so it must be completely clean. Because it is a \texttt{.csv} file,
you'll have no highlighting or bolding or any other special formatting.
If you have missing values, they should be indicated as \texttt{NA} in
the file. If you obtain the file in R, and then write it to a .csv file,
you should write the file without row numbers if you already have an
identification variable. To do so, you should be able to use
\texttt{write.csv(dataframeinR,\ "newfilename.csv",\ row.names\ =\ FALSE)}
where you will substitute in the name of your data frame in R, and new
(.csv) file name. Don't use the same name for your original data set and
your tidy one.

\textbf{Note} If your ``tidy'' \texttt{.csv} file contains more than
6,000 rows after any rows with missing outcomes have been deleted, and
after applying any necessary inclusion/exclusion filters, then you will
be sampling from that file (to create samples of 4,000 for the
``training set'' and 2,000 for the ``test set'') as part of your
analyses in \protect\hyperlink{taskG}{Task G}), but the tidy
\texttt{.csv} should contain all rows in the data, up to the maximum
permitted of 250,000.

\hypertarget{the-codebook}{%
\section{The Codebook}\label{the-codebook}}

For almost any data set, the measurements you calculate will need to be
described in more detail than you will sneak into the spreadsheet. The
code book contains this information. At minimum it should contain:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Information about the variables (including units and codes for any
  categorical variables) in your tidy data set
\item
  Information about the summary choices or transformations you made or
  the development of any scales from raw data
\end{enumerate}

By reading the codebook, I should understand what you did to get from
the raw data to your tidy data, so add any additional information you
need to provide to make that clear.

\hypertarget{the-study-design}{%
\section{The Study Design}\label{the-study-design}}

Here is where I want you to put the information about the experimental
study design you used. You can and should reuse (and edit) the
information you provided as part of the Proposal in this Codebook. The
material you need here consists of three parts from the proposal,
updated to mirror your current plan. Specifically, you should provide:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Your research question describes your outcome, your key predictor and
  other predictors, and the population of interest. It is probably
  easiest to follow one of these formats\footnote{You are welcome to
    move the clauses around to make for a clearer question.}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the effect of \texttt{*your\ key\ predictor*} on
  \texttt{*your\ outcome*} adjusting for
  \texttt{*your\ list\ of\ other\ predictors*} in
  \texttt{*your\ population\ of\ subjects*}?
\item
  How effectively can \texttt{*specify\ your\ predictors*} predict
  \texttt{*your\ outcome*} in \texttt{*your\ population\ of\ subjects*}?
  or
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  A thorough description of the data collection process, with complete
  details as to the nature of the variables, the setting for data
  collection, and complete details of any apparatus you used which may
  affect results that \textbf{has not already been covered} in the
  codebook materials.
\item
  Specification of the subjects and methods involved.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Who are the subjects under study? How many are included in your
    final tidy data set?
  \item
    When were the data gathered? By whom?
  \item
    What caused subjects to be included or excluded from the study?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{taskG}{%
\chapter{Task G (The Portfolio) Instructions}\label{taskG}}

Task G requires you to provide a written portfolio of materials, which
you will also make use of in your final presentation.

The Portfolio is due at noon on 2018-12-13, via
\href{https://canvas.case.edu/}{Canvas}.

\hypertarget{what-will-you-submit}{%
\section{What Will You Submit?}\label{what-will-you-submit}}

There are four things (2 \texttt{.Rmd} and 2 \texttt{.html} files) you
will submit for Task G.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  {[}\texttt{.Rmd} and \texttt{.html} files{]} Your document describing
  the six required analyses for Study 1 (as listed below), as both a
  Markdown file and HTML result that work with the data provided to you
  for Study 1.
\item
  {[}\texttt{.Rmd} and \texttt{.html} files{]} Your document describing
  the nine required analyses for Study 2 (as listed below), as both a
  Markdown file and HTML result that work with the clean and tidy data
  set you submitted in \protect\hyperlink{taskF}{Task F}.
\end{enumerate}

In addition, if something has happened to require you to change your
clean and tidy data set for Study 2 from the one you submitted in Task
F, then \textbf{please resubmit} a clean version of the new Study 2 .csv
here, as well.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Do not submit zipped files.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{setting-up-your-r-markdown-files}{%
\section{Setting Up Your R Markdown
Files}\label{setting-up-your-r-markdown-files}}

You will prepare separate R Markdown files for Study 1 and Study 2. In
each, we would like you to include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a table of contents
\item
  where each section and subsection is numbered
\item
  code-folding, so we can hide code if we like in the HTML, but see it
  by default.
\end{itemize}

Do not hide any code. Do not print out anything larger than a tibble
summary. Make sure that the final product (HTML) looks terrific, and
that the R Markdown file contains more explanation than code, and that
explanation is written in complete sentences.

You are welcome to use any R Markdown formatting approach (for instance,
tabs, or a floating table of contents, or other flourishes) that
accomplishes the objectives specified above, but we do want to see the
results in HTML, rather than any other format.

\hypertarget{the-six-required-analyses-for-study-1-1}{%
\section{The Six Required Analyses for Study
1}\label{the-six-required-analyses-for-study-1-1}}

The initial work for your portfolio will include all of the code you
used to merge the data sets provided to you for Study 1, then select the
variables you'll actually use in your analyses, and then clean up and
manage any remaining issues within those variables in your data.
Following that work, the required analyses for the Project Survey that
need to be in your Portfolio are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A two-group comparison of population means (could use paired or
  independent samples)
\item
  An analysis of variance with Tukey HSD pairwise comparisons of
  population means across K subgroups, where 3 \(\leq\) K \textless{} 7
\item
  A regression model to amplify the indepedent samples comparison in a
  or b by incorporating a quantitative covariate.
\item
  A 2x2 Table and resulting analyses for comparison of two population
  proportions in terms of relative risk, odds ratio and probability
  difference
\item
  A two-way JxK contingency table where 2 \(\leq\) J \textless{} 7 and 3
  \(\leq\) K \textless{} 7 with an appropriate chi-square test
\item
  A three way 2 x 2 x J contingency table analysis whch will expand your
  2x2 table from \#4 and where 3 \(\leq\) J \textless{} 7
\end{enumerate}

Each analysis should be self-contained (so that I don't have to read
Analysis 1 first to understand Analysis 3, for example). Present each
new analysis as a subsection with an appropriate heading in the table of
contents, so we can move to a new analysis efficiently. Each analysis
should begin with a paragraph explaining what you are doing, specifying
the items being used, and how you are using them, and then conclude with
a paragraph of discussion of the key conclusions you draw from your
detailed analyses, and a discussion of any limitations you can describe
that apply to the results.

\textbf{Missing Data}: If you have missing data on any of the variables
you study in Project Study 1, then you will need to do simple imputation
as part of the associated Study 1 analyses. In that case, you should
show the imputation process in your code, and describe explicitly any
choices you made, then run the necessary analysis on both the imputed
sample and the sample using complete cases alone, and compare the two
results.

You should generally follow the comparison plan you outlined in
\protect\hyperlink{taskD}{Task D}. If you need to make a change, please
indicate that in the text setting up each analysis.

A demonstration of an appropriate analysis for each of the required
pieces of Study 1 Analysis will be provided to you at
\url{https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study1}.

\hypertarget{the-nine-required-steps-for-study-2}{%
\section{The Nine Required Steps for Study
2}\label{the-nine-required-steps-for-study-2}}

For your portfolio presentation in Study 2 (Your Data) complete these
steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Identify all the variables in your tidy data set that have missing
  (NA) values. Delete all observations with missing outcomes (actually,
  this much you should have done before submitting the tidy data in Task
  F), and now use simple imputation to impute values for the candidate
  predictors with \texttt{NA}s. Use the resulting imputed data set in
  all subsequent work. Be sure to describe any choices you make in
  building your imputed data set.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Note} If your data set contains more than 6,000 rows after
    any rows with missing outcomes have been deleted, and after applying
    any necessary inclusion/exclusion filters, then you will be sampling
    from that file\footnote{The usual choice is to select a random
      sample of 6,000 observations, without replacement.} (to create a
    sample of 6,000 observations - which you will soon divide into
    samples of 4,000 for the ``training set'' and 2,000 for the ``test
    set'') here.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Obtain a training sample with a randomly selected 67-80\% of your
  data\footnote{The training sample should be 67\% of the data if you
    have 6,000 rows. If you have 250 rows, 80\% of the data should be in
    the training sample. Otherwise, anything in the range of 67-80\% is
    OK.}, and have the remaining 20-33\% in a test sample, properly
  labeled, and using \texttt{set.seed} so that the results can be
  replicated later. Use this training sample for Steps 3-7 below.
\item
  Using the training sample, provide numerical summaries of each
  predictor variable and the outcome, as well as graphical summaries of
  the outcome variable. Your results should now show no missing values
  in any variable. Are there any evident problems, such as substantial
  skew in the outcome variable?
\item
  Build and interpret a scatterplot matrix to describe the associations
  (both numerically and graphically) between the outcome and all
  predictors. Use a Box-Cox plot to investigate whether a transformation
  of your outcome is suggested. Describe what a correlation matrix
  suggests about collinearity between candidate predictors.
\item
  Specify a ``kitchen sink'' linear regression model to describe the
  relationship between your outcome (potentially after transformation)
  and the main effects of each of your predictors. Assess the overall
  effectiveness, within your training sample, of your model, by
  specifying and interpreting the R\textsuperscript{2}, adjusted
  R\textsuperscript{2} (especially in light of your collinearity
  conclusions below), the residual standard error, and the ANOVA F test.
  Does collinearity in the kitchen sink model have a meaningful impact?
  How can you tell? Specify the size, magnitude and meaning of all
  coefficients, and identify appropriate conclusions regarding effect
  sizes with 90\% confidence intervals.
\item
  Build a second linear regression model using a subset of your four
  predictors, chosen by you to maximize predictive value within your
  training sample. Specify the method you used to obtain this new model.
  (Backwards stepwise elimination is a likely approach in many cases,
  but if that doesn't produce a new model, feel free to select two of
  your more interesting predictors from the kitchen sink model and run
  that as a new model.)
\item
  Compare this new (second) model to your ``kitchen sink'' model within
  your training sample using adjusted R\textsuperscript{2}, the residual
  standard error, AIC and BIC. Specify the complete regression equation
  in both models, based on the training sample. Which model appears
  better in these comparisons of the four summaries listed above?
  Produce a table to summarize your results. Does one model ``win'' each
  competition in the training sample?
\item
  Now, use your two regression models to predict the value of your
  outcome using the predictor values you observe in the test sample. Be
  sure to back-transform the predictions to the original units if you
  wound up fitting a model to a transformed outcome. Compare the two
  models in terms of mean squared prediction error and mean absolute
  prediction error in a Table, which Dr.~Love will \textbf{definitely
  want to see} in your portfolio. Which model appears better at
  out-of-sample prediction according to these comparisons, and how do
  you know?
\item
  Select the better of your two models (based on the results you obtain
  in Steps 7 and 8) and apply it to the entire data set. Do the
  coefficients or summaries the model show any important changes when
  applied to the entire data set, and not just the training set? Plot
  residuals against fitted values, and also a Normal probability plot of
  the residuals, each of which Dr.~Love \textbf{will be looking for} in
  your portfolio. What do you conclude about the validity of standard
  regression assumptions for your final model based on these two plots?
\end{enumerate}

In the Study 2 work, each step should begin with at least one complete
sentence explaining what you are doing, specifying the variables being
used, and how you are using them, and then conclude with at least one
complete sentence of discussion of the key conclusions you draw from the
current step, and a discussion of any limitations you can describe that
apply to the results. Present each new step as a subsection with an
appropriate heading that shows up in the table of contents, so we can
move to a new step efficiently in reviewing your work.

A demonstration of an appropriate analysis for each of the required
steps of Study 2 Analysis will be provided to you at
\url{https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study2}.

\hypertarget{taskH}{%
\chapter{Task H (Your Presentation) Instructions}\label{taskH}}

Your Presentation will be held on 2018-12-10, 2018-12-11 or 2018-12-13
in Dr.~Love's office (Wood WG 82-L), as determined by the Scheduling
Process in \protect\hyperlink{taskB}{Task B}.

The Schedule of Project Presentations is now available at
\url{http://bit.ly/431-2018-project-schedule}.

\hypertarget{logistics}{%
\section{Logistics}\label{logistics}}

Arrive at Dr.~Love's office (Wood WG-82L on the ground floor of the Wood
building at the School of Medicine) at your arrival time, which is ten
minutes before your starting time. The complete schedule will be posted
after the scheduling process (\protect\hyperlink{taskB}{Task B}) is
complete in October.

If the door is open, please be sure that Dr.~Love knows you are there.
He likes to get ahead of the schedule whenever possible. If the door is
closed, wait nearby so that you can hear the door when it opens and then
present yourself.

You will give your final presentation in a 20-minute meeting with
Dr.~Love. This will involve materials from both of your studies, in a
fairly regimented way, described below.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You will need to bring a functioning laptop which you can use to show
  me the key results as you describe them for each of the analyses in
  Study 1 and in Study 2 that you wind up discussing.
\item
  You are welcome to show me results in the context of a
  Powerpoint-style presentation, if you prefer to develop one, or to
  show me results straight from your Markdown-created HTML files in your
  portfolio. Whatever works for you - so long as I can see what you are
  talking about as you are talking, we'll be fine.
\item
  The computers in my office will be busy while we are meeting, so I
  will NOT be able to pull up your portfolio or data while we are
  talking. You will have to be able to do that.
\item
  It is 100\% appropriate for you to ask questions before the
  presentation, of Dr.~Love or the TAs. Please do.
\item
  At the presentation, there will be a little time for Dr.~Love to
  address any lingering questions, and he's eager to hear your questions
  at that time, too.
\end{itemize}

If you have an emergency on the day of your presentation, email Dr.~Love
as soon as possible.

\hypertarget{study-1-presentation-6-8-minutes-total}{%
\section{Study 1 Presentation (6-8 minutes,
total)}\label{study-1-presentation-6-8-minutes-total}}

In Study 1, you will first select your most interesting / intriguing
result out of your six main analyses and present that, in about 2
minutes. In those 2 minutes, you should be showing me the highlights of
that Analysis, specifically:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What question were you investigating?
\item
  What conclusion did you draw about that question?
\item
  What statistical method led you to that conclusion?
\end{enumerate}

I will then ask you to present the results of one of the other five main
analyses, in a similar way. You will need to come prepared to present
this information for any of your six Study 1 analyses at a moment's
notice, as you will not know in advance which of your other five main
analyses I will ask for.

\hypertarget{study-2-presentation-10-12-minutes-total}{%
\section{Study 2 Presentation (10-12 minutes,
total)}\label{study-2-presentation-10-12-minutes-total}}

In Study 2, you will start with telling me about the most important
finding of your little study in four minutes. In these 4 minutes, you
will tell me:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What your research question was
\item
  Why it was interesting to you (parts 1 and 2 combined should take no
  more than 30 seconds)
\item
  What your better model has to say about the answer to your research
  question

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This should include a description of the predictors that wound up in
    your (final) model and the direction of each of their effects on
    your outcome. Show me the model as you're telling me about this.
  \item
    This should also include a sense of how well the model predicted
    overall (R\textsuperscript{2} is one good choice)
  \item
    This should also include how well the residual plots for your final
    model fit regression assumptions. Show me the plots as you're
    telling me about this.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Your conclusions about rational next steps to learn more from these
  data, or what specific new data you now wish you'd had when you
  started the study.
\end{enumerate}

For most of the remaining time, I will ask you about your study, and try
to help you think through any problems you had in obtaining or
interpreting analyses. You should come prepared to share any of the nine
steps of your analysis at a moment's notice, as we may want to look at
any part of your work.

\hypertarget{final-questions-about-2-minutes}{%
\section{Final Questions (about 2
minutes)}\label{final-questions-about-2-minutes}}

Depending on time, I may ask you any of several questions at the end of
our meeting. Some possibilities you should be prepared for\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What percentage of your time in Study 2 did you spend obtaining,
  cleaning, merging and tidying data, as opposed to actually performing
  analyses on tidy data?
\item
  Tell me something useful that you learned from doing the project.
\item
  Tell me what the hardest part of doing the project was.
\item
  What do you know now that you wished you'd known back when you were
  formulating the proposal, way back in Task A? What would you tell
  yourself if you could go back in time?
