# Course Project Demonstration for Study 1

This page provides a demonstration of the sorts of analyses we are asking you to complete for your project Study 1 (using the class survey.) 

We will use data from a prior class survey, gathered in two data files (called `survey2015raw_a` and `survey2015raw_b`) available on [the Data and Code page of our website](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-data).

To access the materials, visit [INSERTLINKHERE] for the HTML version, or download the R Markdown code at [INSERTLINKHERE] to use as a template for your own work.

The current version is as yet incomplete but it will soon include demonstrations of [all six required analyses](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/taskG.html#the-six-required-analyses-for-study-1-1) in addition to the other required elements for your final portfolio regarding Study 1.

And yes, there will also be a demonstration project for Study 2.
