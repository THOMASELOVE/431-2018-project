# Course Project Demonstration for Study 1

This page provides a demonstration of the sorts of analyses we are asking you to complete for your project Study 1 (using the class survey.) 

We will use data from a prior class survey, gathered in two data files (called `survey2015raw_a` and `survey2015raw_b`) available on [the Data and Code page of our website](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-data).

## Accessing the Materials

To access the materials, [visit this link to view the HTML version](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/blob/master/demo_study1/431-project-study1-demonstration.html), or [download the R Markdown code here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/master/demo_study1/431-project-study1-demonstration.Rmd) to use as a template for your own work.

## Current Status

The current version is incomplete but it will soon include demonstrations of [all six required analyses](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/taskG.html#the-six-required-analyses-for-study-1-1) in addition to the other required elements for your final portfolio regarding Study 1.

## If I just mimic what you did, will I do well on Project Study 1?

Not really, no. You should probably mimic my YAML code to set up the document, but I expect you can do a lot of things more efficiently and effectively on your own than I can. I'm trying to include a lot of things you son't necessarily need to do in your case. You should also be displaying some creativity, in terms of visualization, but more importantly, showing some good sense about what you do and don't need in order to convince a skeptic of the value of your results, and make the work as replicable as possible.

But each of the analyses I'm showing is done as correctly as I can do it. I'm not trying to confuse you.

## Will there also be a demonstration project for Study 2?

Yes, I expect that to be posted in November, but maybe I'll get it up before Halloween.
