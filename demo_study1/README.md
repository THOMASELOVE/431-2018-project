# Course Project Demonstration for Study 1

This page links to a demonstration of the sorts of analyses we are asking you to complete for your project Study 1 (using the class survey.)  In this demonstration, we use data from a prior class survey, gathered in two data files (called `survey2015raw_a` and `survey2015raw_b`) available on [the Data and Code page of our website](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-data).

## Accessing the Materials

HTML and R Markdown versions, along with the data used to build the examples, are all available at the Shared Google Drive folder you can access (after logging into Google via CWRU) at http://bit.ly/431-2018-demo-study1.

To **view** the HTML file, you can download it, or you can view it at http://rpubs.com/TELOVE/study1-demo-431-2018.

## Current Status

The most recent version includes demonstrations of [all six required analyses](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/taskG.html#the-six-required-analyses-for-study-1-1) in addition to the other required elements for your final portfolio regarding Study 1. Again, you will find this material at http://bit.ly/431-2018-demo-study1.

## What confidence level should I use?

Note that weâ€™ll use a 90% confidence level throughout this demonstration project for all analyses, and I encourage you to do this in your actual Project Study 1 work, as well, given that your sample size will also be small (near 50).

## If I just mimic what you did, will I do well on Project Study 1?

Not really, no. You should probably mimic my YAML code to set up the document, but I expect you to do many things more efficiently and effectively by tailoring the work to your project more than I can here. I'm trying to include a lot of things you won't necessarily need to do. 

Focus on displaying some creativity, in terms of visualization, but more importantly, focus on showing good sense about what you do and don't need in order to convince a skeptic of the value of your results, and make the work as replicable as possible. As an obvious example, you wouldn't want to show ways of testing a hypothesis when the data don't support the underlying assumptions, but here, I show all ways of doing just about everything.

That said, each of the analyses I'm showing is done as correctly as I can muster. I'm not trying to confuse you.

## Will there also be a demonstration project for Study 2?

Yes, I expect that to be posted in November, but maybe I'll get it up before Halloween.
